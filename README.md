# Predicting Dolutegravir Resistance from HIV-1 Integrase Sequences using Nucleotide Transformer

**Hannah Keenhold, Abigail Yohannes, & Bardia Balazadeh**

## Project Overview
Dolutegravir (DTG) is one of the most widely used HIV-1 integrase inhibitors. However, emerging resistance mutations threaten its long-term treatment success. This project uses **InstaDeep’s Nucleotide Transformer (NT)** to learn sequence-level patterns associated with DTG resistance.

We generate embeddings from HIV-1 integrase sequences aquired form stanford HIV database and trained a **logistic regression classifier** to predict whether each sequence is resistant or susceptible, using performance metrics such as accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.
